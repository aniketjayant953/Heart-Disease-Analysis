# Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction

The heart disease dataset contains patient information aimed at diagnosing heart conditions. It includes demographic data, clinical measurements, and test results. By analyzing this data, researchers can identify patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease, helping to understand the prevalence across different age groups, with a higher occurrence typically seen in middle-aged and elderly individuals.

## Data Details

The heart disease dataset consists of various patient features that aid in diagnosing and evaluating heart conditions. Key data points include:
- Age
- Gender
- Types of chest pain
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia status

This comprehensive dataset helps identify factors contributing to heart disease, which typically occurs more frequently in middle-aged and elderly individuals.

## Important KPIs

- Total Count of Individuals with Heart Diseases
- Average Resting Blood Pressure
- Average Cholesterol
- Average Maximum Heart Rate during vigorous exercise

## Insights

### Demographics

- **Gender**: Males suffer from heart disease more than females, although this is just a sample.
- **Age**: Middle-aged individuals seem to have a higher likelihood of heart disease.

### Disease by Age

The risk of heart disease typically increases with age, peaking around 40-60 years old, and then decreases for elderly individuals over 60. ST depression below 2 is mostly indicative of having heart disease.

### Deeper Insights

- **Cholesterol and Blood Pressure**: Often show a positive correlation where higher blood pressure is associated with higher cholesterol levels. There is no significant difference in these metrics whether an individual has heart disease or not, but values between 120-130 show significance.
- **Heart Rate and Blood Pressure**: There's typically a downward trend in maximum heart rate with resting blood pressure. However, there can be spikes in maximum heart rate readings, particularly between 120-130 beats per minute, which might indicate the presence of heart disease.
